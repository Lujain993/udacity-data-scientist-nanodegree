Introduction:
In this project, I did the analysis for Stack Overflow Survey Data 2017. This is a survey data which I downloaded from their website. This data contains 51,392 responses. I used jupyter notebook to do the analysis which you can find in AnalyzingStackOverflowSurveyData.ipynb file.



I answered three questions:
1- How to start learning programming with no formal technical education?
2- Is it worth to learn programming and start working as developer?
3- Does the companies trust in developers with no formal technical education?



Result Summary
Self learning is the most common way to learn programming.
Above the half of the developers satisfied with their careers.
Approximately all the developers who donâ€™t have a formal IT education have a job.
